Hello there!

This is the second part of the task (Problem solving)

Initialize the project with `npm i` and run the tests with `npm test`

by default `npm test will rul file order_log00.csv`

if you want to run another file you can do it with `npm test name file_name_here`
for example `npm test name order_log01.csv`
